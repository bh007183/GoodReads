Sometimes even to live is an act of courage.....<break time="4s"/>True happiness is to enjoy the present,,,,, without anxious dependence upon the future,,,,, not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears but to rest satisfied with what we have,,,,, which is sufficient,,,,, for he that is so wants nothing.....

A wise man is content with his lot,,,,, whatever it may be,,,,, without wishing for what he has not.....<break time="4s"/>Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.....<break time="4s"/>Non est ad astra mollis e terris via" - "There is no easy way from the earth to the stars<break time="4s"/>We suffer more often in imagination than in reality<break time="4s"/>All cruelty springs from weakness.....<break time="4s"/>Religion is regarded by the common people as true,,,,, by the wise as false,,,,, and by rulers as useful.....<break time="4s"/>Difficulties strengthen the mind,,,,, as labor does the body.....<break time="4s"/>You act like mortals in all that you fear,,,,, and like immortals in all that you desire<break time="4s"/>As is a tale,,,,, so is life: not how long it is,,,,, but how good it is,,,,, is what matters.....<break time="4s"/>If a man knows not to which port he sails,,,,, no wind is favorable.....<break time="4s"/>Hang on to your youthful enthusiasms -- you’ll be able to use them better when you’re older.....<break time="4s"/>It is the power of the mind to be unconquerable.....<break time="4s"/>It is not the man who has too little,,,,, but the man who craves more,,,,, that is poor.....<break time="4s"/>The time will come when diligent research over long periods will bring to light things which now lie hidden..... A single lifetime,,,,, even though entirely devoted to the sky,,,,, would not be enough for the investigation of so vast a subject............... And so this knowledge will be unfolded only through long successive ages..... There will come a time when our descendants will be amazed that we did not know things that are so plain to them............... Many discoveries are reserved for ages still to come,,,,, when memory of us will have been effaced.....<break time="4s"/>It is not that we have so little time but that we lose so much..... ...............

The master of a fool<break time="4s"/>For what prevents us from saying that the happy life is to have a mind that is free,,,,, lofty,,,,, fearless and steadfast - a mind that is placed beyond the reach of fear,,,,, beyond the reach of desire,,,,, that counts virtue the only good,,,,, baseness the only evil,,,,, and all else but a worthless mass of things,,,,, which come and go without increasing or diminishing the highest good,,,,, and neither subtract any part from the happy life nor add any part to it?A man thus grounded must,,,,, whether he wills or not,,,,, necessarily be attended by constant cheerfulness and a joy that is deep and issues from deep within,,,,, since he finds delight in his own resources,,,,, and desires no joys greater than his inner joys.....<break time="4s"/>It is not that we have a short time to live,,,,, but that we waste a lot of it..... Life is long enough,,,,, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested..... But when it is wasted in heedless luxury and spent on no good activity,,,,, we are forced at last by death’s final constraint to realize that it has passed away before we knew it was passing..... So it is: we are not given a short life but we make it short,,,,, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of it… Life is long if you know how to use it.....<break time="4s"/>Were all the geniuses of history to focus on this single theme,,,,, they could never fully express their bafflement at the darkness of the human mind..... No person would give up even an inch of their estate,,,,, and the slightest dispute with a neighbor can mean hell to pay; yet we easily let others encroach on our lives—worse,,,,, we often pave the way for those who will take it over..... No person hands out their money to passersby,,,,, but to how many do each of us hand out our lives!

You will meet it,,,,, if you have to,,,,, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present.....<break time="4s"/>Our life is what our thoughts make it.....<break time="4s"/>Whenever you are about to find fault with someone,,,,, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize?<break time="4s"/>If someone is able to show me that what I think or do is not right,,,,, I will happily change,,,,, for I seek the truth,,,,, by which no one was ever truly harmed..... It is the person who continues in his self-deception and ignorance who is harmed.....<break time="4s"/>I have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more than all the rest of men,,,,, but yet sets less value on his own opinion of himself than on the opinion of others.....<break time="4s"/>If it is not right do not do it; if it is not true do not say it.....<break time="4s"/>The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority,,,,, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane.....<break time="4s"/>Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself in your way of thinking.....<break time="4s"/>When you wake up in the morning,,,,, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling,,,,, ungrateful,,,,, arrogant,,,,, dishonest,,,,, jealous and surly..... They are like this because they can't tell good from evil..... But I have seen the beauty of good,,,,, and the ugliness of evil,,,,, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth,,,,, but the same mind,,,,, and possessing a share of the divine..... And so none of them can hurt me..... No one can implicate me in ugliness..... Nor can I feel angry at my relative,,,,, or hate him..... We were born to work together like feet,,,,, hands and eyes,,,,, like the two rows of teeth,,,,, upper and lower..... To obstruct each other is unnatural..... To feel anger at someone,,,,, to turn your back on him: these are unnatural.....<break time="4s"/>The best revenge is not to be like your enemy.....<break time="4s"/>Reject your sense of injury and the injury itself disappears.....<break time="4s"/>Live a good life..... If there are gods and they are just,,,,, then they will not care how devout you have been,,,,, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by..... If there are gods,,,,, but unjust,,,,, then you should not want to worship them..... If there are no gods,,,,, then you will be gone,,,,, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones.....<break time="4s"/>When another blames you or hates you,,,,, or people voice similar criticisms,,,,, go to their souls,,,,, penetrate inside and see what sort of people they are..... You will realize that there is no need to be racked with anxiety that they should hold any particular opinion about you.....<break time="4s"/>How much more grievous are the consequences of anger than the causes of it.....<break time="4s"/>The first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit..... The second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are.....<break time="4s"/>Do not act as if you were going to live ten thousand years..... Death hangs over you..... While you live,,,,, while it is in your power,,,,, be good.....<break time="4s"/>Here is a rule to remember in future,,,,, when anything tempts you to feel bitter: not "This is misfortune,,,,," but "To bear this worthily is good fortune.....<break time="4s"/>Think of yourself as dead..... You have lived your life..... Now,,,,, take what's left and live it properly..... What doesn't transmit light creates its own darkness.....<break time="4s"/>Look well into thyself; there is a source of strength which will always spring up if thou wilt always look.....<break time="4s"/>How much time he gains who does not look to see what his neighbour says or does or thinks,,,,, but only at what he does himself,,,,, to make it just and holy.....<break time="4s"/>You always own the option of having no opinion..... There is never any need to get worked up or to trouble your soul about things you can't control..... These things are not asking to be judged by you..... Leave them alone.....<break time="4s"/>Begin each day by telling yourself: Today I shall be meeting with interference,,,,, ingratitude,,,,, insolence,,,,, disloyalty,,,,, ill-will,,,,, and selfishness – all of them due to the offenders’ ignorance of what is good or evil.....<break time="4s"/>You are a little soul carrying about a corpse,,,,, as Epictetus used to say.....<break time="4s"/>What we do now echoes in eternity.....<break time="4s"/>Do every act of your life as though it were the very last act of your life.....<break time="4s"/>Begin each day by telling yourself: Today I shall be meeting with interference,,,,, ingratitude,,,,, insolence,,,,, disloyalty,,,,, ill-will,,,,, and selfishness – all of them due to the offenders’ ignorance of what is good or evil..... But for my part I have long perceived the nature of good and its nobility,,,,, the nature of evil and its meanness,,,,, and also the nature of the culprit himself,,,,, who is my brother (not in the physical sense,,,,, but as a fellow creature similarly endowed with reason and a share of the divine); therefore none of those things can injure me,,,,, for nobody can implicate me in what is degrading..... Neither can I be angry with my brother or fall foul of him; for he and I were born to work together,,,,, like a man’s two hands,,,,, feet or eyelids,,,,, or the upper and lower rows of his teeth..... To obstruct each other is against Nature’s law – and what is irritation or aversion but a form of obstruction.....<break time="4s"/>Do not indulge in dreams of having what you have not,,,,, but reckon up the chief of the blessings you do possess,,,,, and then thankfully remember how you would crave for them if they were not yours.....<break time="4s"/>Perfection of character is this: to live each day as if it were your last,,,,, without frenzy,,,,, without apathy,,,,, without pretence.....<break time="4s"/>The impediment to action advances action..... What stands in the way becomes the way.....<break time="4s"/>Look back over the past,,,,, with its changing empires that rose and fell,,,,, and you can foresee the future too.....<break time="4s"/>For it is in your power to retire into yourself whenever you choose.....<break time="4s"/>At dawn,,,,, when you have trouble getting out of bed,,,,, tell yourself: “I have to go to work — as a human being..... What do I have to complain of,,,,, if I’m going to do what I was born for — the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?”So you were born to feel “nice”? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Don’t you see the plants,,,,, the birds,,,,, the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks,,,,, putting the world in order,,,,, as best they can? And you’re not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren’t you running to do what your nature demands?You don’t love yourself enough..... Or you’d love your nature too,,,,, and what it demands of you.....<break time="4s"/>The universe is change; our life is what our thoughts make it.....<break time="4s"/>Your days are numbered..... Use them to throw open the windows of your soul to the sun..... If you do not,,,,, the sun will soon set,,,,, and you with it.....<break time="4s"/>Remember that very little is needed to make a happy life.....<break time="4s"/>A man’s worth is no greater than the worth of his ambitions.....<break time="4s"/>Never esteem anything as of advantage to you that will make you break your word or lose your self-respect.....<break time="4s"/>Casting aside other things,,,,, hold to the precious few; and besides bear in mind that every man lives only the present,,,,, which is an indivisible point,,,,, and that all the rest of his life is either past or is uncertain..... Brief is man's life and small the nook of the earth where he lives; brief,,,,, too,,,,, is the longest posthumous fame,,,,, buoyed only by a succession of poor human beings who will very soon die and who know little of themselves,,,,, much less of someone who died long ago.....<break time="4s"/>Don't go on discussing what a good person should be..... Just be one.....<break time="4s"/>Receive without conceit,,,,, release without struggle.....<break time="4s"/>It is in your power to withdraw yourself whenever you desire..... Perfect tranquility within consists in the good ordering of the mind,,,,, the realm of your own.....<break time="4s"/>If any man despises me,,,,, that is his problem..... My only concern is not doing or saying anything deserving of contempt.....<break time="4s"/>Just that you do the right thing..... The rest doesn't matter..... Cold or warm..... Tired or well-rested..... Despised or honored..... Dying...............or busy with other assignments..... Because dying,,,,, too,,,,, is one of our assignments in life..... There as well: "To do what needs doing....." Look inward..... Don't let the true nature of anything elude you..... Before long,,,,, all existing things will be transformed,,,,, to rise like smoke (assuming all things become one),,,,, or be dispersed in fragments...............to move from one unselfish act to another with God in mind..... Only there,,,,, delight and stillness...............when jarred,,,,, unavoidably,,,,, by circumstances,,,,, revert at once to yourself,,,,, and don't lose the rhythm more than you can help..... You'll have a better grasp of the harmony if you keep going back to it.....<break time="4s"/>How ridiculous and how strange to be surprised at anything which happens in life<break time="4s"/>A person's worth is measured by the worth of what he values.....<break time="4s"/>The things you think about determine the quality of your mind.....<break time="4s"/>Life is neither good or evil,,,,, but only a place for good and evil.....<break time="4s"/>It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people,,,,, but care more about their opinion than our own.....<break time="4s"/>Whatever anyone does or says,,,,, I must be emerald and keep my colour.....<break time="4s"/>
